- **$1.7 billion** in costs over 5 years
- **1,744 deaths** attributed to communication breakdowns

--

#### Pediatric-Specific Challenges
- **Limited patient participation** due to age
- **Multiple caregivers** (parents, specialists, school)
- **Increasing medical complexity**
- **High-volume, fast-paced** environments

--

#### Common Communication Failures
- Handoff errors (shift changes, sign-offs)
- Inadequate family communication
- Missing critical information during transitions
- Language and cultural barriers

# The Cost of Poor Quality

```{r cost-table}
cost_data <- data.frame(
  "Quality Issue" = c("PICU Readmission", "Pediatric HA-BSI", "PICU Nosocomial Infection", "Congenital Malformation Readmission"),
  "Key Cost Metric" = c("Mean total hospital costs", "Attributable healthcare cost", "Median additional cost", "Average readmission cost"),
  "Value (USD/EUR)" = c("$40,261 vs $22,735", "$1,642 - $160,804", "€30,791.4", "$26,300"),
  "Impact" = c("77% higher for readmitted", "Wide variation by case", "8x higher PICU LOS", "Highest by condition type")

      caption = "Financial Impact of Quality Issues in Pediatrics",
      format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)
```

#### Key Takeaways
- Readmissions cost **12.4% more** than index admissions.
- Pediatric readmission rates are **10-13%**.
- Patients with complex conditions drive the **highest costs**.
- Prevention through QI has a clear **return on investment**.

#### The Four Stages

**Plan**: Define objective, predict outcome, plan the test.

**Do**: Implement the change, collect data, note observations.

**Study**: Analyze data, compare to predictions, summarize learnings.

**Act**: Adopt, adapt, or abandon the change. Repeat the cycle.
]

#### Key Success Factors
- **Iterative cycles** that build on each other
- **Small-scale tests** to start
- **Prediction-based** testing
- **Data-driven** decisions

# PDSA in Action: Reducing CAUTIs in PICU

#### The Problem
- Increased CAUTI rates in PICU.
- Nurses using povidone-iodine instead of soap/water protocol.

--

#### PDSA Cycle 1: Assessment & Education
- **Plan/Do**: Survey staff on care practices.
- **Study/Act**: Found only **8.8%** compliance → Created educational flyers.

--

#### PDSA Cycle 2: Re-assessment
- **Plan/Do**: Post-education survey.
- **Study/Act**: Compliance improved to **97.2%** → Identified need to modify bundle.

--

#### PDSA Cycle 3: Hardwiring the Change
- **Plan/Do**: Modified CAUTI bundle checklist & started targeted rounding.
- **Study**: Achieved **100%** compliance with soap/water use.
- **Act**: **Zero CAUTIs** reported in the year following the intervention.

.pull-right[
#### Types of Measures
- **Structure**: The "what" - EHRs, staffing, equipment.
- **Process**: The "how" - Actions taken, adherence to protocols.
- **Outcome**: The "result" - Impact on patient health (mortality, readmissions).

#### Why Process Measures Matter
> *"Every system is perfectly designed to get the results it gets."* - Dr. Paul Batalden

- They are **actionable** and reveal **root causes** of poor outcomes.
- They help reduce **undesirable variation** in care.

# Balancing Measures: Avoiding Unintended Consequences

.pull-left[
#### What Are They?
- Measures to monitor for **unintended negative effects** elsewhere in the system when you make a change.
- They answer the question: *"Are we improving one thing at the expense of another?"*

#### Example: Reducing ED Length of Stay
- **Primary Measure**: Time from arrival to discharge.
- **Balancing Measures**:
  - 30-day readmission rate, Staff satisfaction/burnout, etc
]

.pull-right[
#### Example: Increasing Resident Safety Reporting
- **Primary Measure**: Number of safety reports submitted.
- **Result**: Increased from 0.9 to **5.7** per period.

#### Balancing Measures
- **Time to feedback**: Did response time for residents get worse?
- **Duplicate/Non-event submissions**: Did report quality decrease?
- **Result**: No drop in quality, but feedback time was variable, identifying a new QI target.

# Case Study: A "Weighty" Mistake

#### The Case
- **Patient**: 17-month-old with periorbital cellulitis.
- **Error**: Weight entered in EMR as **25 kg** instead of **25 lbs** (11.3 kg).
- **Result**: Clindamycin dose was nearly **doubled**.

--

#### The Error Chain
1. **Triage nurse** entered incorrect weight in EMR.
2. **Resident** prescribed based on the wrong weight.
3. **Attending** approved the order.
4. **Pharmacist** dispensed the incorrect dose.
5. **Nurse** administered the medication.
6. **Four doses** were given before the **mother** (a medical student) caught the error.

--

#### Key Learning Points
- **Multiple safety barriers failed**.
- **Technology** (the EMR) propagated the initial error.
- **Human verification** and critical thinking remain essential.

# Systems Thinking for Safety
## Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

---

# Root Cause Analysis: Beyond Individual Blame

#### Definition
A **structured, systematic process** to discover the fundamental underlying causes of an adverse event to identify solutions that prevent recurrence.

--

#### Key Principles
- Focus on **HOW and WHY** it happened, not **WHO** did it.
- It is **system-oriented**, not person-oriented.
- The goal is **prevention**, not punishment.

--

#### RCA for Diagnostic Errors
- **Traditional RCA** often avoids analyzing clinical judgment.
- **Diagnostic Error RCA** **MUST** include a deep dive into cognitive factors and biases.
- **Crucial additions**: Clinicians involved are active team members; patient/family involvement is essential.

# The Fishbone Framework for Diagnostic Errors (1/2)

### Four Key Domains to Investigate

.pull-left[
#### The Case
- Disease presentation (atypical?)
- Urgency and evolution
- Rarity of condition

#### The Patient  
- Communication barriers
- Adherence issues
- Complex social factors
]

.pull-right[
#### The Clinicians (Reasoning)
- Knowledge gaps
- Information gathering/synthesis
- **Cognitive biases**

#### The Context of Care
- Access to care/expertise
- EHR usability, Teamwork
- Workload, distractions
]

# Systems Thinking for Safety
## Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)

---

# FMEA: Proactive Risk Assessment

#### Definition
A **proactive, systematic, team-based** methodology to identify potential failures in a process **before** they occur, and prioritize actions to prevent them.

--

#### Core FMEA Steps
1. **Map** the process.
2. **Brainstorm** potential "failure modes" (what could go wrong?).
3. **Analyze** causes and effects of each failure.
4. **Score** each failure to prioritize risk.
5. **Develop** action plans to mitigate high-priority risks.

--

#### Risk Priority Number (RPN)
- **RPN = Severity × Occurrence × Detectability**
- A high score means the risk is severe, likely, and hard to detect.
- This helps focus improvement efforts where they matter most.

# Just Culture vs. Blame Culture

```{r just-culture-comparison}
culture_data <- data.frame(
  Aspect = c("Response to Error", "Focus", "Reporting", "Learning"),
  `Blame Culture` = c("Punish individual", "Who is at fault?", "Discouraged by fear", "Limited / Missed"),
  `Just Culture` = c("Analyze system factors", "How/why did it happen?", "Encouraged / Safe", "Maximized")
)

kable(culture_data, 
      caption = "Blame Culture vs. Just Culture",
      format = "html",
      col.names = c("Aspect", "Blame Culture", "Just Culture")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

#### A Just Culture...
- Balances system design and individual accountability.
- Fosters psychological safety to report errors and near-misses.
- Differentiates between **human error** (console), **at-risk behavior** (coach), and **reckless behavior** (discipline).
- Views errors as opportunities to learn and improve the system.
